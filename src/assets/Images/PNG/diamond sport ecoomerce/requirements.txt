E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
F-
I am looking for a skilled web designer to build an e-commerce website from scratch for me. The main purpose of the website is to sell premium softball and baseball digital recruiting content. Key Requirements: - The website should be designed to cater specifically to e-commerce needs, with a focus on user-friendliness and conversion optimization. - As I will be providing all of the content for the website, including text, images, and videos, I need a developer who can effectively integrate these into the site. Some items to consider: > Business Name: Diamond Sports Recruiting > Slogan: Your Path to Athletic Scholarships > Baseball and Softball Recruiting service - providing student-athletes the tools and resources to get recruited and get scholarships > HTML Logo Colors: e51a1a, 012555, a2cffe, 022138. Not every color needs to be these colors on the website, just providing guidance on the Logo colors. > Example Site: https://productiverecruit.com/ design clean and easy to navigate. Must be able to build something similar but CANNOT BE AN EXACT DUPLICATE OF DESIGN > This is a profession business website and must be fast and VERY reliable. > I am not sure Word Press is the best option. Would like recos on the best option that still allows control panel access to make changes and update content easily. > As I will be providing all of the content for the website, including text, images, and videos, I need a developer who can effectively integrate these into the site and design based on the attached logo. 1) Ecommerce capabilities - to access content and tools behind paywall (Premium content). Stripe will be the credit card processor. - Subscription - monthly subscription, yearly subscription and a 4 year option - Would have access to a bundle of tools and content with the subscription - Also ability to Purchase items separately - Currently, everything is digital that they would be purchasing; an ebook, downloadable list of information, access to the search tool, etc 2)Robust user dashboard/profile once logged into their account, this is where they will have access to the tools, content, etc based on their subscription level. a)Profile page (Build your Brand) - you would need to be able to edit the profile from the user dashboard, once logged in - Every client would have a webpage profile that is viewable by anyone - web link could be something like this www.diamondsportsrecruiting.com/jane_doe If there is more than 1 person with the same name, you would add 1 at the end, then 2, etc - Example of the player profile - https://fastpitchprofile.com/Player_Demo - Would need a similar layout (not exact), similar info, and everything would be updated from the user dashboard. Ability to embed youtube videos. Ability to change color scheme by player through the dashboard would be a plus. - The idea here is a user could send their link to college coaches (or share via social media) and they could come and review their profile. - Would need a demo page built (like this https://fastpitchprofile.com/Player_Demo) so I can link to it to show the value of the profile from pricing page ,etc. b) Section on the dashboard to see favorited colleges - from the customer facing search tool. On the User Dashboard, it would show schools the user has favorited c)A section on dashboard to access the tools and content 3) Premium Content - Customer-Facing Search Tool - behind paywall (example of design look and feel I am going for https://www.studylab.me/dashboard/college-finder & https://www.appily.com/colleges) - Leverage the database to pull the results (being constructed separately will share more details) - Develop an algorithm to provide the best results based on user inputs for academics and athletics. MUST BE ABLE TO write a multi-criteria algorithm to rank results based on user inputs accurately. - Each metric will need to be weighted based on the user inputs. See below for more details. - Academic Input Options include: (1) Division - NCAA D1, NCAA D2, NCAA D3, NAIA, JUCO, All. Would need to allow users to select 1 to many inputs. (2) Majors - see the major search box on https://www.appily.com/colleges - would like something similar only using the data in our database - start typing the major you want to search for and a list appears below - allowed to enter multiple selections (3) College Type: Public or Private - user may select one or both (4) Cost: $, $$, $$$, $$$$ (5) Enrollment Size - Small (<5,000), Midsize (5,000 - 15,000), Large (>15,000) (6) Campus Size: Small, Medium, Large - based on acre size in data base (7) Acceptance Rate: Most Selective (0 - 10%), Very Selective (10% - 25%), Selective (25% - 50%), Less Selective (50% - 75%), Not Very Selective (75% - 100%) (8) Specialty: HBCU - if checked would only return these schools. (9) Geographic Region: All, Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, West - I will provide states that fall into each region - Athletic Input Options: (1) Grad Year - 2025, 2026, 2027, etc (2) Positions Played - P, C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, LF, CF, RF, OF, MIF, Corners - allow user to pick their top 2 positions - Diamond Score for each result based on the algorithm assessing academic and athletic inputs: 1% Diamond Sports Score (lowest fit) to 100% Diamond Sports Score (Best fit) (see attached example_ Diamond Sports Score) - Each school would be evaluated based on academic inputs, generate an academic score, and then evaluate the athletic needs of a team and generate an athletic score. Take those scores to create one overall Diamond Sports Score. The athletic score is a little predictive modeling because we will have latest roster data and for example say that they will have 4 people graduating from the college team the same year the user is graduating high school. This would be weighted higher than a school that will only have 1 girl graduating that year. Then layer on the position and we should have a pretty good idea a list of schools that will need a certain position for each graduating year. Of course on the athletic side if there is a match in position needs and a higher # of players needed, they will receive the highest athletic score. - Data Visualization: Implement data visualization features to present search results in a user-friendly manner. Example - https://www.studylab.me/dashboard/college-finder - Unique User Experience: Ensure each user has a unique, isolated experience when accessing the tool simultaneously. - Result Management: Enable users to view results on the site or download them for offline use. 4) Premium Content - Each college and University would have it’s own page (behind paywall). If you clicked the search results for a university - it would take you to this page. It can be a standard template for all schools and pull the relevant details from the data base. - There are ~1,653 schools that will need pages. Example - https://productiverecruit.com/athletic-scholarships/softball/new-jersey/stevens-institute-of-technology - A summary page that you could navigate to the individual college pages https://productiverecruit.com/athletic-scholarships/softball 5) Premium Content - Page behind paywall - Downloadable lists College Coach Search feature - user selects a few inputs such as Division, conference, or school, and it returns a list that is downloadable or download the whole list to a google sheet, excel or csv file. Example - https://www.recruitref.com/dashboard/sports/softball 6) Blog Something similar to this https://productiverecruit.com/blog Need to be able to add posts and potentially video updates very easily 7) Robust Contact Us Form 8) Pricing Page - similar to https://productiverecruit.com/pricing 9) Free Recruiting Tools Page 10) Why Diamond Sports Page 11) Login Page 12) About Page 13) Mobile optimized - potential app development in the future 14) SEO - including being able to update meta content/descriptions 15) Google Analytics 16) Ability to add as many pages as needed 17) Ability to update content on current pages 18) Built in social - sharing on X, and other social sites. 19) Internal Search - within the site 20) Robust Control Panel - access to update content, add content, add pages, pricing, premium content, etc. 21) Integrate an existing database 22) Potentially create new database - user profiles #2 above 23) Transfer website to host when complete 24) Offer min 30 days support to fix bugs after transferring to host and website is live 25) Can site design prevent premium content from being scraped? 26) Built with Security in mind Must-Haves - User-Friendly Tools: Ensure all tools are easy to use for non-technical users. - Data Visualization: Include high-quality data visualization to enhance user experience. - Backend Simplicity: Ensure the website and backend are simple to update. - Attention to Detail: High attention to detail in data classification and categorization.
